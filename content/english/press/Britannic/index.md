### DIVER MAKES ARCHEOLOGICAL DISCOVERY ON TITANIC’S SISTER SHIP, _H.M.H.S. BRITANNIC_, AS PART OF BRITISH-LED EXPEDITION 

Boston - A British-led expedition to explore the sunken wreck of Titanic’s sister ship has made an important underwater archaeological discovery. _H.M.H.S. Britannic’s_ ship’s bell has been found by divers off the coast of Greece more than a century after it sank during the First World War. Expedition leader, Scott Roberts, described the find as “an exciting development in the ongoing quest to discover more about this iconic wreck.”

The ship’s bell is a prized archaeological artifact because it is often the only method of
identification after the sinking of a vessel. Bells also have sentimental significance. They ring
for religious ceremonies, serve as signals, and sound the alarm in emergencies. _Britannic’s_ bell
has remained undiscovered, despite several high-profile exploratory dive expeditions dating back
to the wreck’s discovery by Jacques Cousteau and Doc Edgerton in 1976.

The discovery was made by diver Joe Mazraani and announced on March 7, 2020 at the 66th
Annual Boston Sea Rovers Clinic, an annual event held by the nation’s oldest and most
prestigious dive club. Both Cousteau and Edgerton are Sea Rovers members.

“Like so many children, I was mesmerized by Jacques Cousteau’s discoveries and remember
watching him explore Britannic,” said Mazraani. “The feeling of making even a small
contribution to the continuing story of this spectacular wreck is indescribable.”

HMHS Britannic is thought to be the largest passenger ship currently lying on the seabed. She
was the third and largest vessel in White Star’s Olympic class, which included Olympic and, the
most famous of the three sisters, Titanic. Britannic was converted into service as a hospital ship
during WW1 and sank on November 20, 1916 when she struck a mine. The ship now rests in the
Aegean Sea between mainland Greece and Kea Island at a depth of 400 feet.

Simon Mills, who owns HMHS Britannic, made the dives possible and was with the team for a
portion of their expedition. The Greek Ministry of Marine Antiquities controls all underwater
historic monuments in Greek territorial waters. Removal of any artifact from the wreck is strictly
prohibited by Greek law. The bell remains undisturbed where it was found.

### About the May 2019 _Britannic_ Expedition

The expedition was carried out between the 11th – 22nd of May 2019 with the full cooperation
of the Greek maritime authorities and support from Kea Divers. The dive team included ten
experienced technical divers from three countries: Americans Rick Simon (CT) and Joe
Mazraani (NJ), Australian Scott Wyatt, and British divers Scott Roberts (expedition leader),
Richard Ayrton, Luke Kierman, Jacob MacKenzie, George McClure, Duncan McCormick, and
Steve Pryor.
