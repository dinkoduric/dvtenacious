### DIVERS DISCOVER BOW OF THE _M.S. STOCKHOLM_, SWEDISH SHIP THAT COLLIDED WITH THE _S.S. ANDREA DORIA_ IN 1956

September 14, 2020 – A team of divers from New Jersey-based Atlantic Wreck Salvage, owners
and operators of _Dive Vessel Tenacious_, has discovered the bow wreckage of the _M.S.
Stockholm_, the ship that collided with the _S.S. Andrea Doria_ off the coast of Nantucket on July
26, 1956. During the collision, the _Stockholm_ knifed into the Andrea _Doria’s_ starboard side,
severing a portion of the _Stockholm’s_ icebreaker bow and leaving a gaping wound in the _Andrea_
_Doria_. The _Andrea Doria_ sank in less than twelve hours. The injured _Stockholm_ made it back to
shore under her own steam, without her bow, and carrying with her 500 survivors.

Steve Gatto and Tom Packer, who have been diving the A_ndrea Doria_ since the 1980s and share
arrest rights to the wreck with diver John Moyer, were the first to see the _Stockholm’s_ bow since
it sank more than sixty years ago. “It was awesome!” said Gatto immediately following the dive.
“It took three years of planning with John Moyer, Tom Packer, and _Tenacious_ Captain Joe
Mazraani to make this happen, and we are really lucky to be able to accomplish this goal.
Finding the bow wreckage of the _Stockholm_ bow puts the puzzle together with the _Doria_ and
completes another chapter in the history of this iconic shipwreck.”

The team used side scan sonar to image both the _Andrea Doria_ and wreckage believed to be of
the _Stockholm’s_ bow on August 8, 2020. A team of divers dived it on September 8, 2020 to
visually confirm it was the _Stockholm_. The divers made the confirmation based on the presence
and unique style of both anchors, internal bow reinforcements, accordion-style crumpling on the
wreckage in the same pattern as seen in photos of the Stockholm after the collision, and the
location of the wreckage near the _Andrea Doria’s_ final resting place.

“No discovery happens in isolation. It takes a dive crew, research, and assistance from members
of the larger maritime community,” said Packer. “Locating the _Stockholm’s_ bow would not have
been possible without the collaboration of Montauk Fishermen Paul Forsberg from the Viking
Fleet, and Ben Mahler, who worked with the team to determine the location of the wreck.”

_Andrea Doria_ was built in Genoa, Italy by Gio. Ansaldo & Company. The 700-foot long
passenger was the flagship of the Italian Line, a line of luxury transportation between the United
States and Europe. Although she was not the largest or fastest ship of her day, she was regarded
by many as the most beautiful and referred to by many as a “floating art gallery” with paintings,
murals, sculptures, and tapestries by some of Italy's most prominent artists. On July 26, 1956,
the ship was steaming from the Mediterranean to New York. That same night, the 524-foot
_Stockholm_ departed New York for her home port of Gothenberg, Sweden. The ships collided in a
dense fog. The _Andrea Doria_ perished but the _Stockholm’s_ bow was repaired, and she sailed as a
cruise ship until this year, when she was retired from service for good.

The day after the _Andrea Doria_ sank, investor and diver Peter Gimbel and diver Joseph Fox dove
the ship to chronicle the sinking for Life Magazine. Gimbel and Fox’s photographs appeared in
Life’s August 8 and September 17, 1956 editions and made the _Andrea Doria_ one of the world’s
most famous shipwrecks. Although handfuls of dive expeditions are made to the wreck each
year, the _Andrea Doria’s_ 250-foot depth and condition as well as shifting currents and low
visibility in the waters surrounding the wreck make her an extremely challenging dive.

Tenacious has visited the _Andrea Doria_ regularly since 2010. Moyer, Gatto and Packer own
salvage rights to the wreck, and _D/V Tenacious’_ expeditions are part of their ongoing efforts to
recover and preserve artifacts from this historic luxury liner and to educate the public about her
importance in maritime history. The side scan sonar images show the wreck is rapidly
deteriorating, which make salvage expeditions more important than ever.

The 2020 discovery team includes: Steve Gatto, Tom Packer, John Moyer, Joe Mazraani, John
Copeland, Michael Dudas, Andrew Donn, Jack Lawniczuk, Mark Nix, Jennifer Sellitti, and
Joseph St. Amand.
