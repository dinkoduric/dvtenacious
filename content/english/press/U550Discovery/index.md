### EXPLORERS FIND GERMAN U-BOAT OFF NANTUCKET

July 27, 2012 â€“ Boston, MA Divers have discovered a World War II-era German submarine nearly 70 years after it sank under withering U.S. attack in deep waters off Nantucket. The U-550 was found on Monday by a seven-man group, some of whom have been searching for the lost U-boat for several years. It was the second trip in two years to the site by the team of divers, who were led by New Jersey lawyer Joe Mazraani. He said the group used sonar to locate the wreck in deep water about 70 miles south of Nantucket. The divers photographed the U-550 and Mazraani said a return trip is planned. In April 1944, the U-550 torpedoed an Allied gasoline tanker, but was fatally damaged by depth charges from an escort vessel. Forty-four Germans were killed and 25 aboard the tanker.
