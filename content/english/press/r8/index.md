### _D/V TENACIOUS_ DISCOVERS SUBMARINE OFF DELMARVA PENINSULA

December 10, 2020 – Atlantic Wreck Salvage (AWS), owner and operator of _D/V Tenacious_,
announced today the discovery of a submarine off the Delmarva Peninsula. The vessel has yet to
be dived and visually identified, but based on side scan sonar data, the location, and the historical
record, the team firmly believes it to be the wreckage of the R-8 (S.S. 85), an American
submarine dispatched by experimental aerial bomb testing in 1936. The discovery is historically
important because R-8 is one of few American submarines resting in diveable East Coast waters
that had yet to be located.

The R-8 was one of 27 R-class submarines commissioned by the U.S. Navy during WW1, but
she was not completed until after the Armistice. She was built in 1918 by Fore River
Shipbuilding in Quincy, Massachusetts, a shipyard that built many of the U.S. Navy’s destroyers
and early submarines. R-8 transited the Panama Canal, became a part of the Pacific Fleet, and
participated in Naval training off the coasts of California and the Gulf of Mexico. In 1923, she
sailed west to Pearl Harbor where she participated in training and operations with fleet units for
the next eight years. In 1927, R-8 searched for pilots who had gone missing during the Dole Air
Race, the first airplane race from California to Hawaii. R-8 was called back to the East Coast in
1930 and became part of the Inactive Naval Reserve Fleet at Philadelphia. She sank in the Navy
Yard on February 26, 1936, was raised in April, struck from the Navy list in May, and used as a
target in an aerial bombing test in August. Four near misses with 100 lb. bombs ultimately sent
her to the bottom of the ocean and sealed her fate.

“The sonar data leaves little doubt that the R-8 has been located,” said world-renown sonar
expert Garry Kozak of GK Consulting, who analyzed sonar data with the team. “The submarine
in the image is the correct length, width, and height. One set of prominent features of the R-class
subs visible in the scan image is the spray rail configuration on the conning tower.”

Shipwreck historian, author, and wreck hunter Captain Eric Takakjian and _D/V Tenacious_
Captain Joe Mazraani have been working on the R-8 Project for many years. In 2020, when
AWS acquired side scan sonar capabilities, Mazraani moved _D/V Tenacious_ from her home port
in Point Pleasant, New Jersey to Ocean City, Maryland to conduct searches for R-8’s remains.
Captain Ted Green assisted the team by providing information about potential targets he
gathered throughout his years captaining his dive boat, OC Diver. Veteran wreck diver Mark
Nix, who dove with Green on OC Diver and now dives with D/V Tenacious, was an integral part
of the search team.

“The discovery of any new vessel is exciting,” said Captain Takakjian, who has discovered more
than seventy shipwrecks in his career. “It appears from the sonar images that the site will reveal a
very well-preserved example of an R-class submarine in existence anywhere. We are looking
forward to conducting additional research and to diving the wreck in 2021.”

At this time, the team is not releasing additional information about the depth or the location of
the vessel until they can dive the wreckage and make a formal identification. Side Scan Sonar
images reveal that the vessel is intact and sits upright on the ocean floor. The images were
acquired with a Klein System 3000. Joseph St. Amand subsequently processed the sonar data
using SonarWiz from Chesapeake Technology so the team could compare the vessel on the
ocean floor with historical photographs and plans of the R-8.

This is not the first submarine discovered by _D/V Tenacious_. In 2012, the team discovered the
remains of U-550, the last U-boat thought to remain in diveable North Atlantic waters. R-8
discovery team members Kozak, Mazraani, Tom Packer, and Takakjian were all part of the U-
550 discovery team.

Members of the R-8 discovery team include: Captain Eric Takakjian, Captain Ted Green, Garry
Kozak, Mark Nix, Tom Packer, Christopher Ogden, Jack Lawniczuk, Joseph St. Amand, Jennifer
Sellitti, and Captain Joe Mazraani.
