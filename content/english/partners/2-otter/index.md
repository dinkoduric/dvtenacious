Otter Watersports has always been quality driven, with each dry suit receiving a unique number to allow quality to be closely monitored throughout its manufacturing process.  Each suit is made by just one person, where traceablity ensures constant quality. With each suit being pressure tested for 12 hours without loss of pressure, there is no such thing as a nearly dry Otter Dry Suit.
