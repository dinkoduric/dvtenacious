**_S.S. Andrea Doria_ and _M.S. Stockholm_**

The _S.S. Andrea Doria_ is hallowed ground for shipwreck divers. Divers from all over the world, particularly those who have cut their teeth in the waters of the North Atlantic, dream of one day exploring the wreck. She is located approximately 100 miles from Montauk Point and lays at a depth of 77 meters (255 feet). Although not extremely deep for those with technical experience, the cold water, notorious New England currents, poor visibility, and distance from shore all make diving the _Andrea Doria_ more dangerous than other, even deeper wrecks. Compounding the risk is the complexity of the wreck. The _Andrea Doria_ is 212 meters (701-feet) long and contains a maze of rooms and passageways that are always shifting – constantly transformed by storms, current, and other forces that move the open ocean – making her difficult to navigate even for those who are most familiar with her. Divers refer to her simply and the _Doria_ – one name that symbolizes a milestone in many a dive career.

Atlantic Wreck Salvage is proud to be a part of the _Andrea Doria_ Project, a salvage operation designed to preserve the history and memory of this iconic wreck.

**About the _S.S. Andrea Doria_**

_S.S. Andrea Doria_ was built in Genoa, Italy by Gio. Ansaldo & Company. She was the flagship of the Italian Line, a line of luxury transportation between the United States and Europe. Although she was not the largest or fastest ship of her day, she was regarded by many as the most beautiful. Decorator Pierno Fornasetti adorned the ship with fine marble, ornate vases, and even a bronze statue of 16th-century explorer Andrea Doria himself. Fornasetti’s touch made the _Doria_ the ultimate in contemporary Italian luxury.

On July 26, 1956, the _Doria_ was steaming from several stops in the Mediterranean to New York. On that same night, the _Stockholm_, a 159-meter (524-foot) Swedish passenger-linger departed from New York for her home port of Gothenberg. There was an intense fog. Both captains saw the other ship on radar. Both made decisions about how to navigate. Both believed they had navigated around the other successfully. One of the captains – a debate still rages about which one – miscalculated. At a little after 11 p.m., the _Stockholm’s_ icebreaker bow knifed into the _Doria’s_ starboard side, severing the _Stockholm’s_ bow and leaving a gaping, 45-foot wound in the _Doria_. The _Stockholm’s_ bow was severely damaged, but her captain soon realized she was not in danger of sinking. The _Doria_ was not so fortunate. She began to list to starboard immediately after the collision. Water poured into the ship’s water-tight compartments, eventually overwhelming them. The starboard lifeboats were rendered useless because of the list.

The collision occurred in a major shipping channel, known locally as “Times Square,” which made rescue operations somewhat easier. Many vessels came to the _Doria’s_ aid including the Stockholm, a small freighter Cape Ann, two American Naval ships, and the French ocean liner Ile De France. Fifty-one people lost their lives – 46 on the _Doria_ and five Stockholm crewmembers who were in the bow area of the ship. Most people on the _Doria_ were lost in the initial collision or because they got trapped in interior portions of the ship as she began to list.

It took the _Doria_ almost twelve hours to sink. Captain Piero Calamai was the last to leave his dying ship. He left reluctantly and at the urging of his crew.

**Salvage Diving in the North Atlantic and the Legacy of the _S.S. Andrea Doria_**

It is not an understatement to say that the sinking of the _Andrea Doria_ gave birth to Northeast Atlantic wreck diving. The day after the _Doria_ sank, a team lead by investor and amateur diver Peter Gimbel, of Gimbel Department store fame, dove the _Doria_ in search of riches. In the years that followed, he recovered numerous artifacts, most notably one of her two safes. Life Magazine chronicled the sinking of the ship and Gimbel’s subsequent dives in its August 8 and September 17, 1956 editions.

The ship became Gimbel’s passion and, in the years that followed, he led several expeditions there, which he documented in a series of films. Gimbel’s expeditions were massive undertakings with funding for large vessels, underwater dive bells (in later years), and state-of-the-art technology. The culmination of his work came in 1981, when he raised one of the _Doria’s_ two safes. The crew decided to end their expeditions there – to walk away on a high point having survived almost twenty years of exploration of the wreck.

In 1968, film director Bruno Vailati, together with Stefano Carletti, Mimi Dies, Arnaldo Mattei, and Al Giddings organized and directed the first Italian expedition to the wreck, producing the documentary titled _Andrea Doria_ – 74. Giddings, the only American in the group, went on to become a pioneering underwater cinematographer who won an Academy Award for his work on the film The Abyss and served as co-producer and director of underwater photography on James Cameron’s blockbuster, Titanic.

At the same time, a group of recreational divers began to explore the _Doria_. In 1966, Michael DeCamp, a pioneer of northeast wreck diving, chartered a fishing boat and ran the first of two trips to the wreck. On DeCamp's second trip, Evelyn Bartram Dudas became the first woman to dive the _Doria_. These dives were recreational dives on air and open circuit equipment. The depth was punishing. For those visiting the wreck in small fishing boats on the weekends without the resources to fund major expeditions like Gimbel’s, the risks were high and there was
precious little time for exploration at depth. Although these divers did not know it at the time, in the dark cold waters that entombed the _Doria_, they were planting the seeds of what would one day become the northeast dive community.

Divers visited the _Doria_ infrequently during the 1970s but the accomplishments of DeCamp and his crew haunted the next generation of recreational divers who knew that there was so much more of the _Doria_ to explore. In the 1980s and the 1990s, a group of divers put their heads together to find ways to dive deeper and longer. They pioneered the use of recreational mixed gas diving and used their bodies as laboratories to find new ways to withstand the depth and longer bottom times. They bought fishing boats and refitted them as dive boats so they could access the _Doria_ whenever the weather and their day-jobs allowed. Local legendary dive boats like the Seeker, the Wahoo and the Sea Hunter began making, frequent, multi-day trips to the wreck. Although the equipment and the boats and some names had changed, the community that developed during this time still exists today and continues to inspire wreck divers.

**Artifact Recovery and Preservation**

The allure of the _Doria_ is that local salvage laws permit the recovery of artifacts. Some believe this is necessary for preservation. Others believe that shipwrecks should remain undisturbed for every diver to enjoy. Although archeologists and shipwreck aficionados have differences of opinion about whether it is morally acceptable to recover artifacts, the truth is that the _Doria_ is rapidly degrading. These artifacts will be lost to history without salvage and preservation.
Throughout the years, the _Doria’s_ safe, bell, helm, compass, artwork, and countless other artifacts have been recovered – many by divers who now regularly dive with _D/V Tenacious_, a vessel carrying on the legacy left by the explorers who came before it.

_D/V Tenacious_ has visited the _Doria_ annually since the vessel was christened in 2010. The team includes some of the divers who participated in the 1980s expeditions. Veteran-divers Steve Gatto and Tom Packer have been diving the _Doria_ since that time and have more than 250 and 150 dives on the wreck respectively. Both now dive the Doria regularly from Tenacious. They have intimate knowledge of the Doria and have borne witness to the transformation she has undergone throughout four decades. Gatto and Packer signed the admiralty arrest with John Moyer, the _Doria’s_ owner. Tenacious is honored to help them continue their legacy of discovery.

For some, diving the _Doria_ is a family affair. Divers like Mike Dudas and Andrew Nagle, whose mothers and fathers dived the wreck in the 1960s-80s, are part of a new generation of _Doria_ divers. Pictured left to right: Andrew Nagle (whose father recovered the bell with Tom Packer in 1985), Michael Dudas (whose father and mother both dived with DeCamp on 1967 and ’68 expeditions), Joe Mazraani, Tom Packer, Rick Simon, Steve Gatto, and Tom Zajac.

_Tenacious_ departs from Montauk Point to dive the _Doria_. It is a 10-hour steam to the site. Once the crew arrives, they anchor to the wreck and remain tethered to her for two-to-three days, a procedure pioneered on the 1980s expeditions. Today the dives are technical with divers using rebreathers, computers, and modern mixed gases. Divers complete two dives per day with a goal of approximately five dives each expedition. 100 miles offshore, the eight-person crew must be self-sufficient and watch the weather, monitor the traffic in a major transatlantic shipping lane, and support divers in the water.

Those who dive the _Doria_ often say that no dive on the wreck is the same. The ocean reshapes her from season to season. Without fail, a room or passageway that divers enter one year will be collapsed or buried the next. She is degrading rapidly, her secrets forever sinking beneath the sand.
