summary: Captain Hans Rose's daring raid off the coast of Nantucket in an America
  on the brink of WWI.

---
U-53 commander Hans Rose made an unannounced visit to the Commandant of the United States Second Naval District in Newport Harbor on the morning of October 7, 1916. America had not yet entered WWI. He met with Rear Admiral Gleaves of the American Navy before opening his U-boat to tours in Newport Harbor.  Members of the American Navy, curious spectators who approached in small boats, and even “society girls” were all invited aboard.  Captain Rose’s vessel was immaculate. His crew impressed their American guests with impeccable manners and perfect English. They served fine cakes and tea. Rose, however, was clever, and his visit to Newport was not about pleasantries. It was a calculated show of German military power. He and his crew greatly exaggerated U-53’s range and capabilities during these tours.

Captain Rose did not risk wearing out his welcome when the tours ended. He left Newport within hours of his arrival and set to sea. The next day, U-53 sank five ships south of Nantucket. Powerless to retaliate, the Americans could only watch as the _S.S. Stephano_, _S.S. Strathdene_, _S.S. Blommersdijk_, _S.S. West Point_, and the _M.S. Christian Knudsen_ were blown to the depths. The raid is now regarded as one of a series of events that drew America into WWI. The rules of warfare allowed U-53 to sink any allied ships network carrying goods, munitions, or supplies for the war effort. America had not yet declared war, so American ships were immune from German U-boat attacks but, at the same time, could not engage in attacks to assist other ships that might be in peril.

U-53 first stopped the steamship Kansan but let her go because she was American. The U-boat’s next target, the British cargo ship _Strathdene_, was not so lucky. Rose announced his intentions to sink the ship, allowed the crew to board boats, and sent them towards the Nantucket lightship. He torpedoed the _Strathdene_ aft. Her stern dropped but, she did not sink. He then spotted another steamer in the distance, the Norwegian tanker Christian Knudsen. The Knudsen was carrying fuel to London. Captain Rose ordered the crew into boats and fired a torpedo aft. She did not sink, so he fired a second torpedo.

_West Point_, a British cargo steamer from the Furness Withy Line, became Rose’s next target. The ship continuously transmitted radio signals to warn other ships of U-53’s presence. U-53 quickly silenced her by firing two shots into the steamer’s radio room. Rose sank the ship with blast cartridges and towed her survivors to the Lightship. Next, U-53 spotted the Dutch freighter _Blommersdijk_.

Transmissions from the _Kingston_ and other vessels in the area had alerted the American Navy that there was a U-boat sinking ships off Nantucket. The Navy sent destroyers to investigate. The destroyers approached before Rose could sink _Blommersdijk_, so he dove to give himself time to think. Rose had reason to be concerned. The Americans were growing tired of German U-boats sinking American ships and ships carrying American passengers. U-53’s visit to America came about a year after the May 7, 1915 sinking of the _R.M.S. Lusitania_. 1198 people, many of them women and children, lost their lives when U-20 torpedoed _Lusitania_ off the coast of Ireland. 128 of those who died were American.

Rose’s visit to America’s East Coast came in the wake of the _Lusitania_ disaster. He was conscious that sinking so many ships so close to the coast may be the final straw. He did not want to the U-boat captain who drew America into WWI. He later explained, “The most difficult decision was whether to remain submerged when the American destroyers first approached us.  Had we stayed under the water we would have run less of a risk of immediate conflict with the U.S. but we should also have surrendered the whole purposes of our journey. So we surfaced.”

Rose surfaced to seventeen American destroyers and an ocean littered with lifeboats and sinking ships. The waters were so crowded that one of the destroyers nearly collided with the U-boat.  Each had to reverse engines to avoid collision.  The destroyers were, however, powerless to do any more than pick up survivors and carry them to safety.  The Americans moved out of Rose’s way as he continued to sink targets.

U-53 put two torpedoes in the _Blommersdijk_ before taking its final prize, which would prove the biggest of the day. The British passenger liner Stephano was steaming from Halifax Nova Scotia to New York. She was part of the Red Cross Line. Not to be confused with the American Red Cross, Red Cross was the name of a shipping line owned by Bowring Brothers, Ltd. Its emblem was a black smokestack with a white square and a red cross. Rose remembered the _Lusitania_ and considered letting the passenger ship go, but her captain had already issued the abandoned ship. U-53 waited for the passengers to disembark.  Waiting destroyers rescued them within minutes. U-53 used its last torpedo to sink Stephano when it became apparent that blast cartridges set on the ship would not do the job.

Rose and his crew returned to Germany as heroes, but Rose was concerned that his brazen assault on allied ships right under the nose of the American Navy may have been one step too far. He was, in some ways, correct. It would not be long before his exploits and those of German U-boats operating off the coast of the United Kingdom would cause America to declare war.

## **Locating the U-53 Wrecks**

The remains of four of the five U-53 victims were located in the 1990s by shipwreck hunter and friend of AWS, Captain Eric Takakjian, but the locations far offshore and the state of dive technology at the time rendered the ships largely unexplored until the summers of 2017 and 2018. The _D/V Tenacious_ Team dived the wrecks and confirmed which was which.

The crew identified the cargo ship _Strathdene_ by the munitions she carried. _Christian Knudsen_, which was carrying fuel when she sank, was identified based on her condition on the ocean floor and the location of her engine space in the stern. Divers noticed that she was turtled, or upside down. This occurs when fuel, which is lighter than water, causes the ship to flip and sink upside down. Letters spelling out the ship’s name left no doubt as to which was the _S.S. Stephano_. _Blommersdijk's_ location gave her away.

## **The Elusive _West Point_**

The _West Point_ eluded Captain Takakjian and the team for a few more years. Takakjian and the team continued to collaborate on this project and used information about the existing wrecks, alliances with local fishermen, including legendary fisherman Steve Cannizzo, and historical data to pinpoint the _West Point’s_ final resting place. _D/V Tenacious_ discovered her using side scan sonar on September 9, 2020 and closed this small chapter in WWI history. The crew erupted in celebration when the remains of the cargo ship rolled across the screen.  In addition to obtaining sonar images of the ship, the September 2020 Expedition Team members dived the wreck to confirm her identity. The ship’s size, type, her propulsion machinery, bridge equipment, and location enabled the team to make a positive identification.

The crew has just begun exploring and documenting the U-53 shipwrecks and looks forward to sharing additional information, images, and video as this project continues.
