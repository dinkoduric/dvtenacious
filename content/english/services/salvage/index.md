When it comes to marine salvage operations, Atlantic Wreck Salvage and its highly experienced crew is always ready. No job is too big for AWS. Not only can salvage be performed from our vessel _D/V Tenacious_, but our partnerships with bigger marine salvage companies make any job within reach.

AWS serves clientele who merely need a dive platform or require actual search, survey and recovery missions. Our highly experienced crew has been conducting underwater missions for many years. Decades of combined experience involving anything from the raising of sunken vessels and/or commercial fishing gear, to underwater cutting and excavation, to body recoveries from sunken vessels make our crew the go-to team for any project.

Marine salvage is not always performed for financial gain. AWS is also dedicated to the salvage and restoration of marine artifacts from the thousands of wrecks that litter the Northeastern coast of the United States. Although a foolâ€™s errands on which we expend much money, AWS believes it is highly important to recover and restore these relics so they are not forever lost to the vagaries of the Atlantic Ocean.

The fruits of those salvage efforts are sometimes put on display at local museums for the public to see and to appreciate their historical importance.
