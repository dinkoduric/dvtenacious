Atlantic Wreck Salvage owns and operates a Klein System 3000 digital side scan sonar. The system is perfectly mated to our vessel, _D/V Tenacious_, and we are always ready to go. We have 2 towfish which we believe is absolutely necessary in case one breaks down in the field. Our team can survey at depths up to 250 meters (825 feet).

System 3000 operates at dual simultaneous frequencies 100/500 kHz. The 100 kHz frequency is used to survey at ranges up to 400 meters on both sides of the tow fish.

Our side scan team is highly experienced and always learning advanced techniques under the tutelage of some of the greatest luminaries in the field.

_D/V Tenacious_ and its side scan survey team is available for commercial hire surveys at a competitive rate. Contact us to discuss your project and the applicable rates.
