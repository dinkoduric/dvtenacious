_D/V Tenacious_ is a 45’ NOVI built solid fiberglass vessel serving clientele in the waters off the Northeastern United States. _Tenacious_ was launched in 2010 and is solely owned by Atlantic Wreck Salvage, LLC.

Although small in comparison to other boats, our vessel can and has safely withstood harsh seas far from shore. There are few destinations we cannot reach with our 14-knot speed and 400-mile range.

_Tenacious_ is equipped with up-to-date electronics including but not limited to satellite communication, chirp echo-sounder, multibeam sonar, and side scan sonar. _Tenacious_ has a 1-ton hydraulic winch along with on-deck hydraulic connections for a variety of underwater salvage tools.

_Tenacious_ can accommodate 7 people including its skipper and crew on multi-day trips and up to 10 people on day trips. With full amenities such as a full galley, a full head, a 40” television, air conditioning and a 10kw generator, _Tenacious_ has all the necessary comforts for a hard working boat.

Prior to becoming the _Tenacious_ of today, the vessel operated as a fishing boat off the coast of Maryland. Her skipper, Joe Mazraani, completely redesigned this NOVI as a multi-day offshore work boat sporting a solid dive platform for a competitive rate.
