**PRESENTATIONS AVAILABLE TO TEACHERS AND STUDENTS**

Atlantic Wreck Salvage is committed to educating the public about maritime history. This includes reaching students who will one day be the next generation of underwater explorers.  We offer presentations to middle school and high school teachers to help bring Civil War, WWI, WWII, and Cold War history to life for their students. Our presentations typically focus on one shipwreck warship or Naval battle but put the event into a much larger historical context.

A list of presentations is available for download below. We have included those that go into detail about American or World history but can just as easily customize a presentation to fit school curricula. Presentations can be live via Zoom or pre-recorded and sent as a link.

Atlantic Wreck Salvage has formed an advisory board of educators to work with us to provide additional content to students and teachers, including on-demand access to presentations for teachers through our site.

Current Advisory Board Members include:

* Frederic Allard, High School Social Studies Teacher, Fairfax County Public Schools (VA)
* Mike Boring, Japan-based Diver and Backscatter Pro Photographer
* Marc Corbett, US-based Diver, Historian, and Photographer
* Joanna Dolan, Educator and Co-founder of Titanic Reflections
* Terry Fitzgibbons, History Teacher, Passaic Public Schools
