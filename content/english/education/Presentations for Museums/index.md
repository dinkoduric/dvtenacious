Atlantic Wreck Salvage and the crew of _D/V Tenacious_ speak nationally about shipwreck exploration and discovery. The crew has presented at conferences including Boston Sea Rovers, the Explorer’s Club, Beneath the Sea and for various maritime associations and museums.  We are particularly proud of our ongoing partnership with the New Jersey Maritime Museum, where we present each year about our projects and discoveries.

We offer presentations about any of the shipwrecks we dive. Some of our more popular presentations for museums, associations, and dive clubs are listed below:

#### From Ordinary to Extraordinary: The Merchant Mariner’s Heroic Role in WWII’s Battle for the Atlantic

On April 16, 1994, German U-boat U-550 torpedoed the _S.S. Pan Pennsylvania_ (_"Pan Penn_"), the world’s largest oil tanker of her day. Fifty-six of Pan Penn’s eighty-one crew members survived one of WWII’s most fascinating ocean battles. The battle between _Pan Penn_ and U-550 is just one of thousands that took place in North Atlantic waters during WWII. This presentation explores what became known as the Battle of the Atlantic, the history of the Merchant Marine Service from its development to today, and the vital role both our Navy sailors and Merchant Mariners played in WWII.

#### On the Precipice of WWI: The Legacy of U-53

German U-53 commander Hans Rose made an unannounced visit to the Commandant of the United States Second Naval District in Newport Harbor on the morning of October 7, 1916. America had not yet entered WWI. After a tense visit, the Rose returned to his U-boat sank five British and Norwegian ships in the waters South of Nantucket. Powerless to retaliate, the Americans could only watch as the _Stephano, Strathdene, West Point, Bloomersdijk,_ and _Christian Knudsen_ were blown to the depths. Atlantic Wreck Salvage and our partners have been exploring and documenting these historic wrecks.

#### U-151: WWI On America’s Doorstep

On June 2, 1918 U-151 sank six American ships and damaged two others off the coast of New Jersey in the space of a few hours. The next day the tanker Herbert L. Pratt struck a mine laid by U-151 but was later salvaged. This presentation provides a look at just how close WWI came to our doorstep. _D/V Tenacious’_ owner and operator, Atlantic Wreck Salvage, owns exclusive salvage rights to the _S.S. Carolina_, one of the ships sunk by U-151 on June 2, 1918. The team has undertaken a massive salvage effort to retrieve and restore the bridge equipment and other items from the wreck. Those efforts are ongoing.

#### _Britannic’s_ Lost Bell and the Tragic Story of _Titanic’s_ Sister

_H.M.H.S. Britannic_, sister to _Titanic_, was one of the largest ships of her day and is thought to be the largest passenger ship lying on the seabed. In May of 2019, 10 divers, including two members of _D/V Tenacious’_ crew, set out to explore _Britannic_ and made six dives to her in spectacular conditions. They also made an important archeological discovery, the ship’s long-lost bell.

#### _S.S. Burdigala_: A Magnificent Disaster

This beautiful ocean liner succumbed to the same minefield as the one that claimed _H.M.H.S. Britannic_. She was built by Schichau Werke for Norddeutscher Lloyd and launched in 1897. Her original name was _S.S. Kaiser Friedrich_. Her named changed to _Burdigala_ in 1912 when Cie De Nav Sud-Atlantique, a French Line, purchased the ship. She rests nearby off Kea Island Greece and often serves as a “warm up” for divers on _Britannic_ expeditions. Although often overshadowed by the more famous _Britannic_, she is a stunning ship with a fascinating history that sheds light on steamship travel at the turn of the 19th century.
