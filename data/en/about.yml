D/V Tenacious is the vessel from which AWS’ crew conducts these operations and locates, dives, and salvages shipwrecks. D/V Tenacious and her crew have discovered numerous wrecks in the waters off the eastern seaboard of the United States, the most celebrated of which are U-550, the last German U-boat known to rest in diveable North Atlantic waters, and the American submarine R-8. D/V Tenacious and her expeditions have been chronicled in the books “Where Divers Dare&#58; The Hunt for the Last U- boat,” “Dangerous Shallows, In Search of the Ghost Ships of Cape Cod,” and in media and dive publications worldwide.
